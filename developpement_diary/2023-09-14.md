The code provided is a Go package named timespent that contains helper functions to handle in-game time and format durations. It defines a Format type with two constants, ShortFormat and LongFormat, and a timeSinceBegin variable that keeps track of the time since the game began.

The Increment function is a helper function that increments the timeSinceBegin variable by a given value. The FormatDuration function takes a Format argument and returns a string representation of the duration in either short or long format. The Get function returns the current value of timeSinceBegin, and the Set function sets the value of timeSinceBegin to a given value.

Overall, this package provides useful helper functions for handling in-game time and formatting durations in a game.
