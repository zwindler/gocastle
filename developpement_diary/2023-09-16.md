A big work has been done to replace the myriad of tiles in the scrollableMapContainer grid by one big image, reconstructed from the tilemap.

This involved moving a lot of code around (see [PR 51](https://github.com/zwindler/gocastle/pull/51/files)), but in the end the code was much more clear and free of dirty hacks (like [this](https://github.com/zwindler/gocastle/pull/51/files#diff-9d8f598023ad9276de3c5b68666a75d8a618ecd65fc3742b5b5a2c4eee3fe6c9L87))

Now, the scrollable map contains only a big image on which we move only objects and NPCs.

In order to speed up generation (which is costly and happened every time you changed screen at first), all generated maps are stored (cached) inside the Map struct (and purged when saving).

```diff
type Map struct {
	Name           string
	NPCList        []*model.NPCStats
	ObjectList     []*model.Object
	MapMatrix      [][]int
	MapTransitions []SpecialTile
+	MapImage       image.Image
}
```

Packages theme and embed have also been moved to pkg/ (see #56 and #59)
