Following last work, I created a GetMapMatrixFromEmbed function which reads the content of embedded json files which contain the mapMatrix

This way, I don't have to declare the huge matrices in the maps.go file anymore. The function is really basic and ressemble GetImageFromEmbed (maybe some code can be merged).

Since most of the lines in maps.go has been removed (mapMatrix parts), I decided to merge maps_logic.go back into maps.go

Loading the maps is done in init.go (only for a newgame)

```diff
	if start {
+		// load all pregenerated maps from json
+		for i := 0; i < len(maps.AllTheMaps); i++ {
+			thisMapMatrix, err := embed.GetMapMatrixFromEmbed(fmt.Sprintf("maps/%d.json", i))
+			if err != nil {
+				dialog.ShowError(err, window)
+			}
+			maps.AllTheMaps[i].MapMatrix = thisMapMatrix
+		}
```

Now, I have yet to change a bit the code from [gocastle_maped](https://github.com/zwindler/gocastle_maped) because the json files contain `{"MapMatrix" : [[]]}` which isn't necessary.

Once this is done, I can work on the preview button, maybe reusing the GenerateMapImage() maps
