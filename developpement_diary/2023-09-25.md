For some reason I don't yet understand, when you display the map for the first time (either from a new game or from a screen change like getting out of inventory), the centerMapOnPlayer() function doesn't work.

It's related to the `scrollableMapContainer.Refresh()` call, which seem to reset offset to 0 the first time, but work as expected otherwise.

To workaround the issue, I simple added a bool on the function. This is really weird though because the offset number seemed good and scrolling "just a little bit" refreshed the offset correctly.
