Today's work was focussed on tooling for this project, [gocastle_maped](https://github.com/zwindler/gocastle_maped) (side project of the side project, ahah).

This is a map editor for gocastle, that takes a json containing a MapMatrix [][]uint16, displays it as an editable grid, and can export it back.

To leverage this tool, I have to store gocastle maps in json (like for the save) rather than using the structs in pkg/maps.go. This will be done by storing maps as json embedded files. This way, pregenerated maps won't be bloating golang code files anymore while making it easier to edit (editing the structs by hand is hell).
